# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is a web application that matches the user with another person based on the way they answer a set of questions.  Each question prompts the user to rate their feelings on a scale of 1-5.  Their answers are then compared to the other people's answers in the database and the closest match will be displayed.

You may visit the app at [GitHub] (https://stark-tundra-94893.herokuapp.com/).
